You can optionally save in-game display data values out to an external text file for use with 3rd party programs and/or devices.
To activate the system, create a text file in the game's install folder (where the EXE is located) named savedatasettings.txt
Inside the file needs to be an integer value to specify the update rate for the game to use in milliseconds.
A good setting to start with is 5000, or 5 second updates, which will generally keep the update rate pretty low and shouldn't impact game performance much.

The game will create a file named 'savedata.txt' in the same folder as the EXE and will use the following layout for data:

Pilot Name (string)
